Summary and Impact
------------------
Several issues have been identified, which allow attackers to execute 
JavaScript in the context of other users, forcing others without their
knowledge to e.g. submit motions or vote for them.
X41 did not perform a full test or audit on the software.


Product Description
-------------------
Antragsgrün offers a clear and efficient tool for the effective administration
of motions, amendments and candidacies: from submission to administration and
print template.
A number of organisations are already using the tool successfully such as the
federal association of the German Green Party or the German Federal Youth
Council. It can be easily adapted to a variety of scenarios.

Stored XSS in Motion Proposer Name
==================================
Severity Rating: Medium
Vector: Network
CVE: CVE-2017-16823
CWE: 79
CVSS Score: 5.4 
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N


Summary and Impact
------------------
When submitting a new motion the variable Initiator[primaryName] could
be abused to insert JavaScript into the web page. This could for example
force an administrator to accept the motion. The XSS is triggered when the
signature of the motion is viewed.


Workarounds
-----------
None

Summary and Impact
------------------
When submitting a new motion the variable sections[33] could
be abused to insert JavaScript into the web page. This could for example
force an administrator to accept the motion. The XSS is triggered
when the page "admin/motion/listall" is opened by an administrator.

can use the consolidation name (variable name is SiteCreateForm%5Btitle)
to insert additional HTML and JavaScript into each page. This could be abused
by e.g. including a JavaScript bitcoin mining tool.


Workarounds
-----------
None
