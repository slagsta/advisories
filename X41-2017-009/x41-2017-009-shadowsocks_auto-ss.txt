Status: Public
CVE: Not assgined yet
CWE: 78
CVSS Score: 7.8
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L
Advisory-URL: https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2017-007-shadowsocks_auto-ss/


Summary and Impact
------------------
The Shadowsocks wrapper "auto-ss" logs into the website 
"https://www.ss-link.com/login" and parses a table with Shadowsocks login
credentials and information. It starts Shadowsocks to create a connection with the parsed credentials and server.
When spawning a Shadowsocks connection, the lines 106-109 of auto_ss.py
execute:
"
p = subprocess.Popen(
    "exec " + ss_local_cmd, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    stderr=subprocess.STDOUT
)
"

If an attacker is able to modify "https://www.ss-link.com" due to a man in
the middle attack or a vulnerability on the web page, the parameters could
get modified to execute a command on the machine running ShadowSocks
auto-ss. E.g. ";<evil command>#" could be attached to or used as an
parameter to execute code on target machines.

Product Description
-------------------
Auto-ss is a tool to distribute Shadowssocks server configurations. It is
not part of Shadowsocks itself.


Workarounds
-----------
There is no workaround available, do not use auto-ss until a patch is
released. Passing untrusted input as arguments to shell commands
should be avoided.
