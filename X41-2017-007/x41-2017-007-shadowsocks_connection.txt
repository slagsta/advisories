Summary and Impact
------------------
The Shadowsocks wrapper "ShadowSocks ConnecTion" crawls a web page for
Shadowsocks server credentials. This page is retrieved via unencrypted HTTP
from URI "http://ss.ishadowx.com" as default. It starts Shadowsocks with the
parsed credentials at line 98-101 in version 0.4, line 82-85 in version 0.5 using check_call(sss, shell=True).

If an attacker is able to modify the parsed web page due to a man in the
middle attack, a vulnerability on the web page or through a malicious web
page itself, the parameters could be modified to execute a command on the
machine running ShadowSocks ConnecTion. E.g. ";<evil command>#" could be
attached to or used as an parameter to execute code on target machines.

Product Description
-------------------
ShadowSocks ConnecTion is a wrapper tool for Shadowsocks to consistently
bypass firewalls. It parses a given website for Shadowsocks server
credentials and uses the credentials to connect to a Shadowsocks server.


Workarounds
-----------
There is no workaround available, do not use ShadowSocks ConnecTion until a
patch is released. Passing untrusted input as arguments to shell commands
should be avoided.
